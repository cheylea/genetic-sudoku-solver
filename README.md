# Genetic-Sudoku-Solver

## Introduction
Genetic-Sudoku-Solver is a repository that contains a genetic algorithm that can solve a four letter puzzle in the style of Sudoku.

For example, if provided with the four letter word "WORD" we can use this function to find a solution such that each column, row and subgrid only contains one of each letter.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| W | D | R | O |
| O | R | W | D |
| R | O | D | W |
| D | W | O | R |

The word must have a unique set of letters and can only be four letters long.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Genetic Sudoku Function
To use the function you need to import it into your script.
```python
from src.algorithm import geneticAlgorithm
```

## Example Application

The provided application in the app.py allows the user to input a four letter word and generate a solution.

To run the application, type the following into the terminal:
```bash
python app.py
```

The below shows an example session with the application.


## Testing
In order to ensure there are no detrimental changes to the genetic algorithm, the following tests can be run.

### Runnning Unit Tests
To run the unit tests use the following in the terminal for the test_cases.py file, or substitute with your own test cases.
```
python -m unittest tests/unit_tests.py
```

### Runnning Accuracy Tests
To run the accuracy tests use the following in the terminal for the test_cases.py file, or substitute with your own test cases.
```
